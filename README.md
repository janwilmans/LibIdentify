# LibIdentify
Standard set of methods to identify a project's executable, for now specifically aimed at test-frameworks.

# Abstract / Rationale
The initial reason for the existance of this set of methods is too let [BoostTestUI](https://github.com/djeedjay/BoostTestUi) identify the kind of test it is loading. BoostTestUI is a graphical test runner for windows to run unittests, this proposal should be useful to any test-runner that has to deal with executable binaries from several test frameworks, such as for example [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/)

BoostTestUI's name is kindof obsolete, it would better be named MultiTestUI, because it currently supports Boost.Test, Google Test, Catch and Nunit.

Currently tests need to be re-compiled with a special header that is different per test-framework to be able to do two things:
- identify the framework, in order to know what arguments to pass, to for example list all test or execute a specific test.
- add an option --gui-wait to allow the UI to start the test-process without actually beginning to run anything, allowing the user to attach a debugger.

# Proposed standard

```
foobin --libidentify-identification returns on std:cout:
line 1: description:    <description>           [ascii string, starting at colomn 17, ending at but not including newline]
line 2: category:       <category>              [ascii string, starting at colomn 17, ending at but not including newline]
line 3: framework:      <frameworkname>         [ascii string, starting at colomn 17, ending at but not including newline]
line 4: version:        <version>               [ascii string, starting at colomn 17, ending at but not including newline]
```

- ```<description>``` ascii string for display purposes, not to be used for identification
- ```<category>``` identification of the category the binary belongs to
- ```<framework>``` major part of the identification
- ```<version>``` minor part of the identification 

```<framework>``` may be any string, it shall be unique and stable over all future version of your framework
```<version>``` shall start with <major_version_number>.<minor_version_number>. but after the second dot any text is allowed.

# categories

Currently there is only one valid category:
- testframework

# examples

# Proposed extention for all test frameworks

I propose to add an commandline argument extention to all test frameworks that do not have this yet:

```
for (int i = 0; i < argc; ++i)
{
    auto argument = std::string(argv[i]);
    if (argument == "--wait-for-getchar")
    {
        std::cout << "#waiting" << std::endl;
        std::getchar();
        return;
    }
}
```

Note that this argument can have any name you like, it is not part of the 'libidentify' standard as such.
